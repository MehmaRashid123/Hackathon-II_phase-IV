# Backend Skill – Routes, Requests/Responses, DB Connection

## Instructions

1. **Route Generation**
   - Define endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Use RESTful or GraphQL conventions
   - Organize routes logically by resource

2. **Request Handling**
   - Parse incoming requests (body, query, params)
   - Validate input data
   - Handle authentication/authorization

3. **Response Management**
   - Return proper HTTP status codes
   - Send JSON responses
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. **Database Connection**
   - Connect to relational or NoSQL databases
   - Perform queries using ORM or raw SQL
   - Ensure secure credentials handling

## Best Practices
- Keep endpoints RESTful and consistent
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Handle errors and edge cases properly
- Maintain separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services)
- Close DB connections properly to avoid leaks
